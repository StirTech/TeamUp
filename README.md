## Features

### Summary:
A webapp that helps you find people who want to play a game, whether it's sports or anything else. You can even join games people have started. (meetup for games)

#### Problem: How do I find players to join me in a game, if everyone I now is too busy?

##### Well it's not easy:
- The only real option is going to a place frequented by people who play the game you want and hope they'll allow you to join.

## Our Solution:
A website where people can go and post their games online, and join games that are nearby.
